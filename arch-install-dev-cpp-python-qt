# Installs development tools, such as git, python and gcc.
#
# Passes any script arguments to the pacman commands, so can execute script with
# --noconfirm for instance to run non-interactively proceeding without prompting
# user.
#
# NOTE: Assumes basic tools are already installed, including sudo.
# Run script ./arch-init first to ensure this!
#
# NOTE: Does not install package group "base-devel", which contains a lot of the
# relevant packages (gcc, binutils, make, grep, sed, sudo etc), instead just installs
# any wanted packages individually, and e.g. binutils will be included as depedency
# of gcc. Also e.g. pyside2 includes libpng, libjpeg-turbo, icu etc.. used by others.
#
# NOTE: Remember to either do both --refresh (-y) and --sysupgrade (-u), or none of them,
# at least never --refresh (-y) which will easily lead to the partial upgrades syndrome!
